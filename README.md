# IMGD-5200-Journal-1-Auxiliary-Repo

This repo serves as the auxiliary station to facilitate the codes might be needed for the journal assignment.

## Contents

- This readme.md file
- The python code for encrypt-decrypt process (the one I used to test and generate .txt files)
- The python code for decrypt (the one that is needed to read the submitted assignment).
- The .txt files of the plain text, encrypted text, and decrypted text.

## System Requirement

Tested on Python 3.12.0 without exterior packages, but should run on any computer with python 3 environment.

## How to use

The submitted assignment is the encrypted text. 
You can create a .txt file and copy and paste the submitted texts into it, or directly download the .txt file from this repo.
Then, put decrypt.py into the same folder, and execute it to decrypt the text (that is, so long as your computer has python environment to run it).
