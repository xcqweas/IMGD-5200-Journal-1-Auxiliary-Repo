# IMGD-5000-Journal-1-Auxiliary-Repo

This repo serves as the auxiliary station to facilitate the codes might be needed for the journal assignment.

## Contents

- This readme.md file
- The python code for encrypt-decrypt process (the one I used to test and generate .txt files)
- The python code for decrypt (the one that is needed to read the submitted assignment
- The .txt files of the plain text, encrypted text, and decrypted text.

## How to use

The submitted assignment is the encrypted text. You can create a .txt file and copy and paste the submitted texts into it, or directly download the .txt file in this repo.
